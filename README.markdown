RMate is a [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for [R](http://www.r-project.org/about.html). It is based on the [R/R Console/Rdaemon](http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles) bundles and is focused on:

- easy to use, clear interface/menu
- support for Windows ([E-Texteditor](http://www.e-texteditor.com/))
- editing code, R/Rd snippets and getting help/info
- connect to the standard R frontends (R.app and RGui)
